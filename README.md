# FinLitFun - Financial Literacy Game

## Project Overview

**FinLitFun** is a Python-based educational game developed using Pygame. The game is designed to teach financial literacy through a turn-based simulation where the player makes decisions related to education, career, investments, and more. The goal of the game is to retire as early as possible while maximizing happiness, health, and personal finances.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Fully graphical interface developed with Pygame, replacing all console-based logging.
- **Phased Gameplay**: Players go through different life phases (Early Life, Young Adult, Mid-Life, etc.), making critical decisions that affect their long-term success.
- **Random Events**: Random life events triggered based on playerâ€™s age and probabilities, adding unpredictability to the game.
- **Career and Education Choices**: Players can choose from various educational paths and careers, each affecting their income, happiness, and health.
- **Investment Opportunities**: Players can invest in different opportunities to grow their wealth during the Mid-Life phase.
